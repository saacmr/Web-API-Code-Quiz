## User Story

```
A timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
So that you can gauge your progress
```

## How It Works

```
Taking the code quiz!
When I click the start button a timer starts and I am presented with a question
When I answer a question I am presented with another question
When you answer a question incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock
When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over
When the game is over I can save my initials and my score
When viewing the High Scores you can clear them
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
